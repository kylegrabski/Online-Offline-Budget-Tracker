### Usage  
Add funds or subtract funds and the graph below will show a visualization of the amount of money calculated. If offline, the user can still enter information and see the adjustments. Once back online, those offline adjustments will then be connected to the database and stored.  

This is also a Progressive Web Application that can be downloaded onto your local machine/mobile device.

### Tech Used  
For this app I wrote and connected the MongoDB database and routes using: 
 
>JavaScript  
node.js  
express.js  
sequelize  
Mongoose 

<br>  

## Installation 

After cloning down the repo, be sure to install all node.js dependancies with the command `npm i` in the integrated terminal. 

Ensure your MongoDB database is running locally on your machine. Enter `npm start` to start the local server, default port is 80.
